# About the project

This is a homework project for the Full Stack Developer course, focused on creating a static web page. The project involves replicating the WebStudio page design provided in Figma.


## Lessons Learned

Converting a Figma design into a functional website taught me to interpret design specifications accurately. I now understand how to extract assets, measure distances, and translate visual designs into code.


## Roadmap

- Additional browser support

- Adding more integrations
